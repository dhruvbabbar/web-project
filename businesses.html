                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content sub-para">Thick web switches by Rahee are an ideal solution for heavy haul/ passenger traffic lines as well as for high speed lines. The asymmetrical section in these switches offer a very high lateral rigidity, increasing the life of the switch. These can be supplied for partially or fully canted turnouts.<br><br></p>
                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content sub-para">These switches are made from specific asymmetrical tongue rail sections, forged at the end to match standard rail sections. The transition from one section to the other lies mostly in the clamped area at the end of the switch. Thus welding becomes superfluous in the flexible area.<br><br></p>
                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content sub-para">The length of the forging can be adjusted to the specific connecting system such as welding, insulated fishplating or emergency fishplating. In order to reduce the setting forces and to influence the elastic strength of the switch, the base of the switch rail is milled in the flexible area.<br></p>

                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Rahee’s HTW crossing is a monolithic structure, where the Vee is formed from two separate pieces of rails, with a steel plate sandwiched in between.The plate is Electro-slag welded and machines to form a solid nose. The weld metal hardness, at the top of the rail head and in the weld cross section, ranges from 330 to 360 BHN.The Wing Rails are head hardened through induction hardening method with subsequently controlled cooling, to obtain fine pearlitic grain structure. The Wing Rails and the Vee are bolted together by high tensile bolts, to form a complete HTW crossing. These crossings can withstand axle loads as high as 25 tones under varying traffic conditions and can be welded to the adjoining rails.HTW crossing can be designed and manufactured as per the client’s specific requirements. Rahee has supplied various types of HTW crossings such as Acute, Obtuse, Diamond, Curved, Extended Nose Type, and Crossings with clothoidal entry.<br>Advantages : <br></p>

                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Rahee can manufacture and supply Swing Nose Crossing (SNC).<br>SNC helps you meet the new age requirements for high speed with high comfort level, which demands continuous movement of rolling stock over gap less tracks and turnouts. Here, the movable nose of the crossing alternately couples with either side of the track, to form continuous rolling tracks. This ensures smooth passage of wheels and reduces jerks, enhancing the life cycles of both wheel and crossing.The crossings have flexibly moving points and splice rails. Longitudinal compensation during setting is achieved through a special bolting between the points, and splice rails which permit relative displacement. As a result, there is no need for an expansion joint in the closure rail. The use of standard rail sections ensures a wide selection of material. Designs are available with or without a continuous base plate.<br>Advantages : <br></p>
                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content bullets"> - Continuous wheel overrunning area (no running edges and head surface interruptions), therefore particularly suitable for high-speed and heavy haul traffic, as well as for mixed operations (different vehicles and wheel set types)<br> - No check rails required – thus ideal for high-speed traffic<br> - Reduces airborne and structure-borne noise<br> - Highest possible service life due to absence of impacts in the wheel transition area. Thus ideal for heavy haul, high speed operations<br> - Can be thermit-welded into the track<br> - With special anti-creep equipment for transmission of longitudinal forces in the continuously welded track<br></p>

                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Increasing the radius in turnouts (to minimize jerks and enhance passenger comfort) requires longer switch lengths. However, rails are not rigid in the longitudinal direction and hence do not provide required clearance even after reasonable opening at toe.<br></p>
                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Rahee’s SSD solves this problem by ensuring housing of the closed tongue rail while maintaining adequate minimum opening of open tongue rail for wheel passage. During the change of setting, the point machine/alternate drive arrangement moves the tongue rail at toe. This, in turn, closes the spring till half its movement; then, for the other half of the tongue movement, the spring thrusts the housed tongue rail against the stock rail to have complete housing. Meanwhile the open tongue rail on the other side opens up adequately for passage of wheel. This is suitable for moderately long switches.<br></p>

                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Steel railroad sleepers are formed from pressed steel and are trough-shaped in section. The ends of the railroad sleeper are shaped to form a &quot;spade&quot; which increases the lateral resistance of the railroad sleeper. Steel railroad sleepers are lighter in weight than concrete and able to stack in compact bundles unlike timber. Steel railroad sleepers can be installed onto the existing ballast, unlike concrete railroad sleepers which require a full depth of new ballast. Steel sleepers are 100% recyclable and require up to 60% less ballast than concrete ties and up to 45% less than wood ties.<br></p>
                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Modern steel railroad sleepers handle heavy loads, have a proven record of performance in signalized track, and handle adverse track conditions. Of high importance to railroad companies is the fact that steel railroad sleepers are more economical to install in new construction. Steel sleepers are utilized in nearly all sectors of the worldwide railroad systems including heavy-haul, class 1’s, regional, short lines, mining, electrified passenger lines (OHLE) and all manner of industries. These sleepers can be supplied with or without cant, with holes or with welded plates.<br></p>
                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Rahee can offer wide range of pad plates and sleeper plates to suit the sleepers together with fasteners. Steel sleepers can be made in conventional and special profiles to suit all types of rail gauges including Broad Gauge, Standard Gauge, Metre Gauge, and Narrow Gauge. Rahee can also manufacture combination gauge steel sleepers to suit two different types of gauges on the same line.<br></p>
                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Steel sleepers are also widely used in the railway tracks running over bridges where a resilient ballast bed cannot be created. Steel Sleepers for Bridges are manufactured using either Steel Channels or H-beam steel section. The sleepers are usually supplied galvanized or metallized to deliver effective service life on bridges. Steel Sleeper over bridges are a much more robust and effective solution as compared to wooden sleepers.<br></p>

                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">Steel channel sleepers are designed for use in the railway tracks running over bridges where a resilient ballast bed cannot be used. Steel channel sleepers are fabricated from steel channel sections, wherein two channels are welded together to obtain the required strength. Both running and guard rails are accommodated on the channel sleeper. The running rails are fixed to the canted bearing plate using clip and bolt rail fastening system. However the guard rails are bolted directly on the sleepers. Rubber pads are also provided under each rail and sleeper to absorb the shocks and dampen the vibrations. Steel channel sleeper with all steel fittings are hot dip galvanized to enhance the service life of the product.<br></p>

                    <p class="bridges-paragraph point-holder-content">H-beam sleepers are exclusively designed to handle the dynamic loads of trains on non-ballasted open deck steel girder bridges. The H-beam sleeper is made of single rolled H-beam section having adequate bearing area, robust structure and accurate dimensions which are more suitable for the tracks running over bridges.Canted bearing plates are riveted on the H-beam sleeper to hold the running rails using rail elastic fastening system.  It is possible to have either zero load or full load fastening system on H-Beam Sleepers as per client requirement. Use of Zero load fastening system (ZRF) on H-beam sleepers ensures that rail creep or thermal expansion forces are not transmitted to the girders. In ZRF system elastic fastenings are used and no extra maintenance tools are involved. It is also possible to replace the rail-free liner by toe-loadable liner wherever required. H-beam sleepers facilitate provision of long welded tracks on bridges.<br></p>
